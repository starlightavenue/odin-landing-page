# Odin Landing Page

This project is a landing page for Starlight Bakery. Starlight Bakery is a cozy spot for dreamers to rest, recharge, and have a tasty treat. Many a manifestation has been cultivated within these walls, and many more are sure to follow. Whether it's through a cup of tea or a slice of cake, I hope the stars align for every soul that crosses the threshold. 👩🏾‍🍳💫
